# Python and Markdown

## Markdown basics

- Hashtags for headings.

### Marking code
- Use backticks to mark something as code, it is only what's within the backticks that's marked as code.
- To mark as a code block start with and end with three backticks.

`print("Hello World!")`

### Highlighting text

- This is how you do italics: _italics_ or *italics*.
- This is how you do bold: **bold**.
- Don't have spaces at the beginning or end of the line, or it won't have the effect.
- To force a new line use a proper '< br >' tag.

### Bullet points vs numbered lists
* Use a * or - at the start.
  * push tab to indent for you.

1. Start with one then a full stop and a space.
2. Use this for when you have to write down steps.
    * You can then indent and go back to bullets to indent.
3. Back to numbers again
