#
# The if statement you make will below will print the meaning of the movie rating specified at the beginning of the code.
#
# You should only need to replace the lines in CAPTIALS with your own code.
#
# Starting code:

# possible film ratings are "universal", "pg", "12", "12a", "15", "18"
film_rating = "12a"

# use an if statement to check for "universal" rating
# IF STATEMENT GOES HERE
if film_rating == 'universal':
    print("all age groups can watch this film")
# check if film rating is "pg"
# ELSE IF STATEMENT GOES HERE
elif film_rating == 'pg':
    print("General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children.")
# check if film rating is "12" or "12a"
# ELSE IF STATEMENT GOES HERE
elif film_rating == '12' or '12A':
    print("Films classified 12A and video works classified 12 contain material that is not generally suitable for "
          "children aged under 12. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless accompanied by "
          "an adult.")
# check if film rating is "15"
# ELSE IF STATEMENT GOES HERE
